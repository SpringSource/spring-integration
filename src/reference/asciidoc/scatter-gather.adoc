[[scatter-gather]]
=== Scatter-Gather

Starting with version 4.1, Spring Integration provides an implementation of the http://www.eaipatterns.com/BroadcastAggregate.html[scatter-gather] enterprise integration pattern.
It is a compound endpoint for which the goal is to send a message to the recipients and aggregate the results.
As noted in http://www.eaipatterns.com[_Enterprise Integration Patterns_], it is a component for scenarios such as "`best quote`", where we need to request information from several suppliers and decide which one provides us with the best term for the requested item.

Previously, the pattern could be configured by using discrete components.
This enhancement brings more convenient configuration.

The `ScatterGatherHandler` is a request-reply endpoint that combines a `PublishSubscribeChannel` (or a `RecipientListRouter`) and an `AggregatingMessageHandler`.
The request message is sent to the `scatter` channel, and the `ScatterGatherHandler` waits for the reply that the aggregator sends to the `outputChannel`.

[[scatter-gather-functionality]]
==== Functionality

The `Scatter-Gather` pattern suggests two scenarios: "`auction`" and "`distribution`".
In both cases, the `aggregation` function is the same and provides all the options available for the `AggregatingMessageHandler`.
(Actually, the `ScatterGatherHandler` requires only an `AggregatingMessageHandler` as a constructor argument.)
See <<aggregator>> for more information.

===== Auction

The auction `Scatter-Gather` variant uses "`publish-subscribe`" logic for the request message, where the "`scatter`" channel is a `PublishSubscribeChannel` with `apply-sequence="true"`.
However, this channel can be any `MessageChannel` implementation (as is the case with the `request-channel` in the `ContentEnricher` -- see <<content-enricher>>).
However, in this case, you should create your own custom `correlationStrategy` for the `aggregation` function.

===== Distribution

The distribution `Scatter-Gather` variant is based on the `RecipientListRouter` (see <<router-implementations-recipientlistrouter>>) with all available options for the `RecipientListRouter`.
This is the second `ScatterGatherHandler` constructor argument.
If you want to rely on only the default `correlationStrategy` for the `recipient-list-router` and the `aggregator`, you should specify `apply-sequence="true"`.
Otherwise, you should supply a custom `correlationStrategy` for the `aggregator`.
Unlike the `PublishSubscribeChannel` variant (the auction variant), having a `recipient-list-router` `selector` option lets filter target suppliers based on the message.
With `apply-sequence="true"`, the default `sequenceSize` is supplied, and the `aggregator` can release the group correctly.
The distribution option is mutually exclusive with the auction option.

For both the auction and the distribution variants, the request (scatter) message is enriched with the `gatherResultChannel` header to wait for a reply message from the `aggregator`.

By default, all suppliers should send their result to the `replyChannel` header (usually by omitting the `output-channel` from the ultimate endpoint).
However, the `gatherChannel` option is also provided, letting suppliers send their reply to that channel for the aggregation.

==== Configuring a Scatter-Gather Endpoint

The following example shows Java configuration for the bean definition for `Scatter-Gather`:

====
[source,java]
----
@Bean
public MessageHandler distributor() {
    RecipientListRouter router = new RecipientListRouter();
    router.setApplySequence(true);
    router.setChannels(Arrays.asList(distributionChannel1(), distributionChannel2(),
            distributionChannel3()));
    return router;
}

@Bean
public MessageHandler gatherer() {
	return new AggregatingMessageHandler(
			new ExpressionEvaluatingMessageGroupProcessor("^[payload gt 5] ?: -1D"),
			new SimpleMessageStore(),
			new HeaderAttributeCorrelationStrategy(
			       IntegrationMessageHeaderAccessor.CORRELATION_ID),
			new ExpressionEvaluatingReleaseStrategy("size() == 2"));
}

@Bean
@ServiceActivator(inputChannel = "distributionChannel")
public MessageHandler scatterGatherDistribution() {
	ScatterGatherHandler handler = new ScatterGatherHandler(distributor(), gatherer());
	handler.setOutputChannel(output());
	return handler;
}
----
====

In the preceding example, we configure the `RecipientListRouter` `distributor` bean with `applySequence="true"` and the list of recipient channels.
The next bean is for an `AggregatingMessageHandler`.
Finally, we inject both those beans into the `ScatterGatherHandler` bean definition and mark it as a `@ServiceActivator` to wire the scatter-gather component into the integration flow.

The following example shows how to configure the `<scatter-gather>` endpoint by using the XML namespace:

====
[source,xml]
----
<scatter-gather
		id=""  <1>
		auto-startup=""  <2>
		input-channel=""  <3>
		output-channel=""  <4>
		scatter-channel=""  <5>
		gather-channel=""  <6>
		order=""  <7>
		phase=""  <8>
		send-timeout=""  <9>
		gather-timeout=""  <10>
		requires-reply="" > <11>
			<scatterer/>  <12>
			<gatherer/>  <13>
</scatter-gather>
----

<1> The id of the endpoint.
The `ScatterGatherHandler` bean is registered with an alias of `id + '.handler'`.
The `RecipientListRouter` bean is registered with an alias of `id + '.scatterer'`.
The `AggregatingMessageHandler`bean is registered with an alias of `id + '.gatherer'`.
Optional.
(The `BeanFactory` generates a default `id` value.)
<2> Lifecycle attribute signaling whether the endpoint should be started during application context initialization.
In addition, the `ScatterGatherHandler` also implements `Lifecycle` and starts and stops `gatherEndpoint`, which is created internally if a `gather-channel` is provided.
Optional.
(The default is `true`.)
<3> The channel on which to receive request messages to handle them in the `ScatterGatherHandler`.
Required.
<4> The channel to which the `ScatterGatherHandler` sends the aggregation results.
Optional.
(Incoming messages can specify a reply channel themselves in the `replyChannel` message header).
<5> The channel to which to send the scatter message for the auction scenario.
Optional.
Mutually exclusive with the `<scatterer>` sub-element.
<6> The channel on which to receive replies from each supplier for the aggregation.
It is used as the `replyChannel` header in the scatter message.
Optional.
By default, the `FixedSubscriberChannel` is created.
<7> The order of this component when more than one handler is subscribed to the same `DirectChannel` (use for load balancing purposes).
Optional.
<8> Specifies the phase in which the endpoint should be started and stopped.
The startup order proceeds from lowest to highest, and the shutdown order is from highest to lowest.
By default, this value is `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, meaning that this container starts as late as possible and stops as soon as possible.
Optional.
<9> The timeout interval to wait when sending a reply `Message` to the `output-channel`.
By default, the send blocks for one second.
It applies only if the output channel has some 'sending' limitations -- for example, a `QueueChannel` with a fixed 'capacity' that is full.
In this case, a `MessageDeliveryException` is thrown.
The `send-timeout` is ignored for `AbstractSubscribableChannel` implementations.
For `group-timeout(-expression)`, the `MessageDeliveryException` from the scheduled expire task leads this task to be rescheduled.
Optional.
<10> Lets you specify how long the scatter-gather waits for the reply message before returning.
By default, it waits indefinitely.
'null' is returned if the reply times out.
Optional.
It defaults to `-1`, meaning to wait indefinitely.
<11> Specifies whether the scatter-gather must return a non-null value.
This value is `true` by default.
Consequently, a `ReplyRequiredException` is thrown when the underlying aggregator returns a null value after `gather-timeout`.
Note, if `null` is a possibility, the `gather-timeout` should be specified to avoid an indefinite wait.
<12> The `<recipient-list-router>` options.
Optional.
Mutually exclusive with `scatter-channel` attribute.
<13> The `<aggregator>` options.
Required.
