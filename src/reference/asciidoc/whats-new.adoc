If you are interested in more details, see the Issue Tracker tickets that were resolved as part of the 5.4 development process.

[[x5.4-new-components]]
=== New Components

[[x5.4-sik]]
==== Apache Kafka Channel Adapters
The standalone https://projects.spring.io/spring-integration-kafka/[Spring Integration Kafka] project has been merged as a `spring-integration-kafka` module to this project.
See <<./kafka.adoc#kafka,Spring for Apache Kafka Support>> for more information.

The `KafkaProducerMessageHandler` `sendTimeoutExpression` default has changed.
See <<./kafka.adoc#kafka-outbound,Kafka Outbound Channel Adapter>> for more information.

==== R2DBC Channel Adapters

The Channel Adapters for R2DBC database interaction have been introduced.
See <<./r2dbc.adoc#r2dbc,R2DBC Support>> for more information.

==== Redis Stream Support

The Channel Adapters for Redis Stream support have been introduced.
See <<./redis.adoc#redis-stream-outbound,Redis Stream Outbound Channel Adapter>> for more information.

==== Renewable Lock Registry

A Renewable lock registry has been introduced to allow renew lease of a distributed lock.
See <<./jdbc.adoc#jdbc-lock-registry,JDBC implementation>> for more information.

[[x5.4-general]]
=== General Changes

The one-way messaging gateway (the `void` method return type) now sets a `nullChannel` explicitly into the `replyChannel` header to ignore any possible downstream replies.
See <<./gateway.adoc#gateway-default-reply-channel,Setting the Default Reply Channel>> for more information.

The aggregator (and resequencer) can now expire orphaned groups (groups in a persistent store where no new messages arrive after an application restart).
See <<./aggregator.adoc#aggregator-expiring-groups, Aggregator Expiring Groups>> for more information.

[[x5.4-tcp]]
=== TCP Changes

Connection factories now support multiple sending components (`TcpSender`); they remain limited to one receiving component (`TcpListener`).
This allows, for example, an inbound gateway and outbound channel adapter to share the same factory, supporting both request/reply and arbitrary messaging from the server to the client.
Shared factories should not be used with outbound gateways, unless single-use connections or the `ThreadAffinityClientConnectionFactory` are being used.
See <<./ip.adoc#ip-collaborating-adapters,Collaborating Channel Adapters>> and <<./ip.adoc#tcp-gateways, TCP Gateways>> for more information.

[[x5.4-rmi]]
=== RMI Changes

The `spring-integration-rmi` module is deprecated with no replacement and is going to be removed in the next major version.
See <<./rmi.adoc#rmi, RMI Support>> for more information.

=== AMQP Changes

The outbound endpoints now have a new mechanism for handling publisher confirms and returns.
See <<./amqp.adoc#alternative-confirms-returns,Alternative Mechanism for Publisher Confirms and Returns>> for more information.

A new `BatchMode.EXTRACT_PAYLOAD_WITH_HEADERS` is supported by the `AmqpInboundChannelAdapter`.
See <<./amqp.adoc#amqp-inbound-channel-adapter,Inbound Channel Adapter>> for more information.
