[[x5.0-new-components]]
=== New Components


[[x5.0-general]]
=== General Changes

==== Core Changes

==== JMS Changes

Previously, Spring Integration JMS XML configuration used a default bean name `connectionFactory` for the JMS Connection Factory, allowing the property to be omitted from component definitions.
Now it has been renamed to the `jmsConnectionFactory` value, which is used by Spring Boot to auto-configure JMS Connection Factory bean.

If your application is relying on the previous behavior, rename your `connectionFactory` bean to `jmsConnectionFactory`, or specifically configure your components to use your bean using its current name.
