== What's new in Spring Integration 4.3?

This chapter provides an overview of the new features and improvements that have been introduced with Spring
Integration 4.3.
If you are interested in more details, please see the Issue Tracker tickets that were resolved as part of the 4.3
development process.

[[x4.3-new-components]]
=== New Components

==== MessageGroupFactory

The new `MessageGroupFactory` strategy has been introduced to allow a control over `MessageGroup` instances
in `MessageGroupStore` logic.
The `SimpleMessageGroupFactory` is provided for the `SimpleMessageGroup` with the `GroupType.HASH_SET` as the default
factory for the standard `MessageGroupStore` implementations.
See <<message-store>> for more information.


[[x4.3-general]]
=== General Changes

==== Outbound Gateway within Chain

Previously, it was possible to specify a `reply-channel` on an outbound gateway within a chain.
It was completely ignored; the gateway's reply goes to the next chain element, or to the chain's output channel
if the gateway is the last element.
This condition is now detected and disallowed.
If you have such configuration, simply remove the `reply-channel`.

==== Mail Changes

The customizable `userFlag` added in 4.2.2 to provide customization of the flag used to denote that the mail has been
seen is now available using the XML namespace.
See <<imap-seen>> for more information.

==== JMS Changes

The `DefaultJmsHeaderMapper` now maps the standard `correlationId` header as a message property by invoking its
`toString()` method.
See <<jms-header-mapping>> for more information.

==== Aggregator Changes

There is a change in behavior when a POJO aggregator releases a collection of `Message<?>` objects; this is rare but if
your application does that, you will need to make a small change to your POJO. See this <<agg-message-collection>> note
for more information.

==== TCP/UDP Changes

A new `TcpConnectionServerListeningEvent` is emitted when a server connection factory is started.
See <<tcp-events>> for more information.

The `destination-expression` and `socket-expression` are now available for the `<int-ip:udp-outbound-channel-adapter>`.
See <<udp-adapters>> for more information.

==== File Changes

===== Destination Directory Creation

The generated file name for the `FileWritingMessageHandler` can represent _sub-path_ to save the desired directory
structure for file in the target directory.
See <<file-writing-file-names>> for more information.

===== Buffer Size

When writing files, you can now specify the buffer size to use.

===== Appending and Flushing

You can now avoid flushing files when appending and use a number of strategies to flush the data during idle periods.
See <<file-flushing>> for more information.

==== AMQP Changes

===== Content Type Message Converter

The outbound endpoints now support a `RabbitTemplate` configured with a `ContentTypeDelegatingMessageConverter` such
that the converter can be chosen based on the message content type.
See <<content-type-conversion-outbound>> for more information.

===== Headers for Delayed Message Handling

Spring AMQP 1.6 adds support for
https://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2015/04/16/scheduling-messages-with-rabbitmq/[Delayed Message Exchanges].
Header mapping now supports the headers (`amqp_delay` and `amqp_receivedDelay`) used by this feature.

==== Redis Changes

===== List Push/Pop Direction

Previously, the queue channel adapters always used the Redis List in a fixed direction,
pushing to the left end and reading from the right end.
It is now possible to configure the reading and writing direction using `rightPop` and `leftPush` options for the
`RedisQueueMessageDrivenEndpoint` and `RedisQueueOutboundChannelAdapter` respectively.
See <<redis-queue-inbound-channel-adapter>> and <<redis-queue-outbound-channel-adapter>> for more information.

===== Queue Inbound Gateway Default Serializer

The default serializer in the inbound gateway has been changed to a `JdkSerializationRedisSerializer` for compatibility
with the outbound gateway.
See <<redis-queue-inbound-gateway>> for more information.

==== HTTP Changes

Previously, with requests that had a body (such as `POST`) that had no `content-type` header, the body was ignored.
With this release, the content type of such requests is considered to be `application/octet-stream` as recommended
by RFC 2616.
See <<http-inbound>> for more information.

==== SFTP Changes

A new factory bean is provided to simplify the configuration of Jsch proxies for SFTP.
See <<sftp-proxy-factory-bean>> for more information.

==== Router Changes

The `ErrorMessageExceptionTypeRouter` supports now the `Exception` superclass mappings to avoid duplication
for the same channel in case of several inheritors.
For this purpose the `ErrorMessageExceptionTypeRouter` loads mapping classes during initialization to fail-fast
for a `ClassNotFoundException`.

See <<router>> for more information.

==== Header Mapping

AMQP, WS and XMPP header mappings (e.g. `request-header-mapping`, `reply-header-mapping`) now support negated
patterns.
See <<amqp-message-headers>>, <<ws-message-headers>>, and <<xmpp-message-headers>> for more information.
