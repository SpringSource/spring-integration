== What's new in Spring Integration 4.2?

This chapter provides an overview of the new features and improvements that have been introduced with Spring Integration 4.1.
If you are interested in more details, please see the Issue Tracker tickets that were resolved as part of the 4.1 development process.

[[x4.2-new-components]]
=== New Components

[[x4.2-JMX]]
==== Major JMX Rework

A new `MetricsFactory` strategy interface has been introduced.
This, together with other changes in the JMX infrastructure provides much more control over JMX configuration and runtime performance.

However, this has some important implications for (some) user environments.

For complete details, see <<jmx-42-improvements>>.

[[x4.2-mongodb-metadata-store]]
==== MongodDB Metadata Store

The `MongoDbMetadataStore` is now available. For more information, see <<mongodb-metadata-store>>.

[[x4.2-secured-channel-annotation]]
==== SecuredChannel Annotation

The `@SecuredChannel` annotation has been introduced, replacing the deprecated `ChannelSecurityInterceptorFactoryBean`.
For more information, see <<security>>.


[[x4.2-file-splitter]]
==== FileSplitter

The `FileSplitter`, which splits text files into lines, was added in 4.1.2.
It now has full support in the `int-file:` namespace; see <<file-splitter>> for more information.

[[x4.2-general]]
=== General Changes

[[x4.2-wire-tap]]
==== Wire Tap

As an alternative to the existing `selector` attribute, the `<wire-tap/>` now supports the `selector-expression` attribute.

[[x4.2-file-changes]]
==== File Changes

The `<int-file:outbound-channel-adapter>` and `<int-file:outbound-gateway>` now support an `append-new-line` attribute.
If set to `true`, a new line is appended to the file after a message is written.
The default attribute value is `false`.

The `ignore-hidden` attribute has been introduced for the `<int-file:inbound-channel-adapter>` to pick up or not
the _hidden_ files from the source directory.
It is `true` by default.

The `FileWritingMessageHandler` now also accepts `InputStream` as a valid message payload type.

See <<files>> for more information.

[[x4.2-class-package-change]]
==== Class Package Change

The `ScatterGatherHandler` class has been moved from the `org.springframework.integration.handler` to the `org.springframework.integration.scattergather`.

==== TCP Changes

[[x4.2-tcp-serializers]]
===== TCP Serializers

The TCP `Serializers` no longer `flush()` the `OutputStream`; this is now done by the `TcpNxxConnection` classes.
If you are using the serializers directly within user code, you may have to `flush()` the `OutputStream`.

[[x4.2-tcp-server-exceptions]]
===== Server Socket Exceptions

`TcpConnectionServerExceptionEvent` s are now published whenever an unexpected exception occurs on a TCP server socket (also added to 4.1.3, 4.0.7).
See <<tcp-events>> for more information.

[[x4.2-tcp-gw-rto]]
===== TCP Gateway Remote Timeout

The `TcpOutboundGateway` now supports `remote-timeout-expression` as an alternative to the existing `remote-timeout` attribute.
This allows setting the timeout based on each message.

Also, the `remote-timeout` no longer defaults to the same value as `reply-timeout` which has a completely different meaning.

See <<tcp-ob-gateway-attributes>> for more information.

[[x4.2-tcp-ssl]]
===== TCP SSLSession Available for Header Mapping

`TcpConnection` s now support `getSslSession()` to enable users to extract information from the session to add to
message headers.

See <<ip-msg-headers>> for more information.


[[x4.2-tcp-events]]
===== TCP Events

New events are now published whenever a correlation exception occurs - for example sending a message to a
non-existent socket. See <<tcp-events>> for more information.

[[x4.2-inbound-channel-adapter-annotation]]
==== @InboundChannelAdapter

Previously, the `@Poller` on an inbound channel adapter defaulted the `maxMessagesPerPoll` attribute to `-1` (infinity).
This was inconsistent with the XML configuration of `<inbound-channel-adapter/>` s, which defaults to 1.
The annotation now defaults this attribute to 1.

[[x4.2-api-changes]]
==== API Changes

`o.s.integtation.util.FunctionIterator` now requires a `o.s.integration.util.Function` instead of a `reactor.function.Function`.
This was done to remove an unnecessary hard dependency on Reactor.
Any uses of this iterator will need to change the import.

Of course, Reactor is still supported for functionality such as the `Promise` gateway; the dependency was removed for those users who don't need it.

[[x4.2-jms-changes]]
==== JMS Changes

The `error-channel` now is used for the conversion errors, which have caused a transaction rollback and message redelivery previously.

See <<jms-message-driven-channel-adapter>> for more information.

[[x4.2-conditional-pollers]]
==== Conditional Pollers
Much more flexibility is now provided for dynamic polling.

See <<conditional-pollers>> for more information.

[[x4.2-amqp-changes]]
==== AMQP Changes

The `<int-amqp:outbound-gateway>` now supports `confirm-correlation-expression` and `confirm-(n)ack-channel`
attributes with similar purpose as for `<int-amqp:outbound-channel-adapter>`.

See <<amqp>> for more information.

[[x4.2-xpath-splitter]]
==== XPath Splitter Improvements

The `XPathMessageSplitter` (`<int-xml:xpath-splitter>`) now allows the configuration of `output-properties`
for the internal `javax.xml.transform.Transformer` and supports an `Iterator` mode (defaults to `true`) for the xpath
evaluation `org.w3c.dom.NodeList` result.

See <<xml-xpath-splitting>> for more information.

[[x4.2-http-changes]]
==== HTTP Changes

The HTTP Inbound Endpoints (`<int-http:inbound-channel-adapter>` and `<int-http:inbound-gateway>`) now allow the
configuration of _Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)_.

See <<cors>> for more information.

[[x4.2-file-filter]]
==== Persistent File List Filter Changes

The `AbstractPersistentFileListFilter` has a new property `flushOnUpdate` which, when set to true, will `flush()` the
metadata store if it implements `Flushable` (e.g. the `PropertiesPersistenMetadataStore`).


[[x4.2-gw-completable-future]]
==== Gateway Methods can Return CompletableFuture<?>

When using Java 8, gateway methods can now return `CompletableFuture<?>`.
See <<gw-completable-future>> for more information.
