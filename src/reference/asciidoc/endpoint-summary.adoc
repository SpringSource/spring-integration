== Endpoint Quick Reference Table

As discussed in the earlier sections, Spring Integration provides a number of endpoints used to interface with external systems, file systems, and others.

For transparent dependency management Spring Integration provides a bill-of-materials POM to be imported into the Maven configuration:

To recap:

* Inbound channel adapters are used for one-way integration to bring data into the messaging application.
* Outbound channel adapters are used for one-way integration to send data out of the messaging application.
* Inbound gateways are used for a bidirectional integration flow, where some other system invokes the messaging application and receives a reply.
* Outbound Gateways are used for a bidirectional integration flow, where the messaging application invokes some external service or entity and expects a result.

The following table summarizes the various endpoints with quick links to the appropriate chapter.

In addition, as discussed in <<spring-integration-core-messaging>>, Spring Integration provides endpoints for interfacing with Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs).
As discussed in <<channel-adapter>>, the `<int:inbound-channel-adapter>` element lets you poll a Java method for data.
The `<int:outbound-channel-adapter>` element lets you send data to a `void` method.
As discussed in <<gateway>>, the `<int:gateway>` element lets any Java program invoke a messaging flow.
Each of these works without requiring any source-level dependencies on Spring Integration.
The equivalent of an outbound gateway in this context is using a service activator (see <<service-activator>>) to invoke a method that returns an `Object` of some kind.
